# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

Three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run:

- If the second argument for `useEffect` (`???`) is removed, meaning no dependency array is passed in, then the effect re-renders every time.

- If an empty array is passed in (replacing the `???` with `[]`), then the effect is rendered once.

- If a non-empty array is passed in, then the effect re-renders whenever a dependency is changed. This can look like using something like`[dependency1, dependency2]`.
