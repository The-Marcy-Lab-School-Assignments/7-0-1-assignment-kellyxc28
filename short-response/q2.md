# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

Three ways we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run:

- If the second argument for `useEffect` (the `???` part) is removed, meaning no dependency array is passed in, then the effect runs every time.

- If an empty array is passed in (replacing the `???` with `[]`), then the effect is rendered once.

- If a non-empty array is passed in, then the effect runs whenever a dependency is changed. This can look like using something like`[dependency1, dependency2]`.

You got it!

~~You got the logic down! Only issue is that you say the effect gets re-rendered, when itâ€™s actually the callback function that gets run, not re-rendered. Make sure to distinguish between rendering and running the effect.~~
